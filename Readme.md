## Motivation
An app that ranks the number of likes on tweets with a specific hashtag. The results are displayed in the Slack channel using Slack's Incoming Webhook.
The main way to use it is to attach the URL of a technical article or other article you've written to a tweet and post it with #CruchtimerShare and the hashtag. By using the number of likes as a substitute for the engagement of that article, you can visualize your contribution to the community.
